# Tail Risk Properties

## CVaR Distribution

The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) distribution across portfolios provides insights into 
tail-risk management effectiveness. CVaR represents the expected loss beyond the VaR threshold, 
offering a coherent risk measure that addresses limitations of variance-based optimization.
