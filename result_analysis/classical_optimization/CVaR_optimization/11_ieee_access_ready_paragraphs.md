## CVaR Methodology and Rockafellar-Uryasev Formulation

The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization framework was applied to generate 100000 
optimal portfolios using the Rockafellar-Uryasev formulation. CVaR, also known as Expected Shortfall, 
represents the expected loss conditional on exceeding the Value at Risk (VaR) threshold, providing a coherent 
risk measure that addresses limitations of variance-based optimization approaches.

## Interpretation of CVaR-Return Frontier

The CVaR-return frontier illustrates the efficient tradeoff between expected return and tail risk. 
Portfolios on the frontier maximize return for a given CVaR level, demonstrating the effectiveness of 
CVaR optimization in managing downside risk while maintaining return objectives.

## Tail-Risk Dominance over Variance-Based Optimization

CVaR optimization offers significant advantages over traditional Markowitz mean-variance optimization by 
explicitly focusing on tail losses rather than overall volatility. This approach is particularly valuable 
for risk-averse investors concerned with extreme downside scenarios, as CVaR captures the magnitude of 
losses beyond the VaR threshold.

## Backtesting and Coherence Properties of CVaR

CVaR satisfies the coherence axioms for risk measures, including monotonicity, translation invariance, 
positive homogeneity, and subadditivity. These properties ensure consistent risk assessment and enable 
reliable portfolio optimization under uncertainty.

## Positioning Relative to Markowitz and Black-Litterman

While Markowitz optimization focuses on mean-variance tradeoffs and Black-Litterman incorporates investor 
views with market equilibrium, CVaR optimization provides a complementary approach emphasizing tail-risk 
management. The scenario-based nature of CVaR optimization allows for explicit modeling of extreme events 
and asymmetric return distributions.
