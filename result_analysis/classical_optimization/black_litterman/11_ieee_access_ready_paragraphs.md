## Experimental Setup

The Black-Litterman optimization framework was applied to generate 100000 
optimal portfolios. The analysis employs market equilibrium returns as priors and incorporates 
investor views to derive posterior return distributions. Portfolio optimization was performed 
using quadratic programming with risk aversion parameters.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals significant variation in portfolio performance across different configurations. 
Risk-return tradeoffs demonstrate the expected positive relationship, with higher returns associated 
with increased volatility. Tail risk measures (VaR and CVaR) provide insights into downside protection, 
while distributional diagnostics indicate deviations from normality in portfolio returns.

## Discussion

The Black-Litterman framework successfully incorporates investor views while maintaining market 
equilibrium as a baseline. Portfolio concentration metrics indicate varying levels of diversification, 
with implications for risk management and regulatory compliance.
