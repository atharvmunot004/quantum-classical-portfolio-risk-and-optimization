## Risk Parity Theory and Equal Risk Contribution Objective

Risk Parity optimization was applied to generate 2619000 portfolios 
with the objective of equalizing risk contributions across assets. Unlike traditional mean-variance 
optimization that maximizes return for a given risk level, Risk Parity focuses on risk budgeting, 
ensuring each asset contributes equally to portfolio risk. This approach addresses the concentration 
bias inherent in return-driven optimization methods.

## Interpretation of Risk Contribution Deviation Metrics

Risk parity deviation scores quantify the degree to which portfolios achieve equal risk contributions. 
Lower deviation scores indicate portfolios closer to perfect risk parity, where risk contributions 
are balanced across all assets. The equal risk gap metric measures the difference between maximum 
and minimum risk contributions, providing insight into risk concentration.

## Diversification Advantages over Return-Driven Optimization

Risk Parity portfolios exhibit superior diversification characteristics compared to return-driven 
optimization approaches. By focusing on risk budgeting rather than return maximization, Risk Parity 
naturally promotes diversification and reduces concentration risk. This is particularly valuable in 
uncertain market conditions where return forecasts are unreliable.

## Comparison Against Equal-Weight and Minimum-Variance Baselines

Risk Parity portfolios are compared against equal-weight and minimum-variance baseline strategies. 
While equal-weight portfolios provide naive diversification, they do not account for asset correlations 
and risk characteristics. Minimum-variance portfolios minimize overall risk but may concentrate in 
low-volatility assets. Risk Parity balances these approaches by equalizing risk contributions while 
accounting for asset correlations.

## Limitations of Volatility-Based Risk Budgeting

Risk Parity optimization relies on volatility as the primary risk measure, which may not fully capture 
tail risk and extreme downside scenarios. Volatility-based risk budgeting assumes symmetric return 
distributions and may underestimate risk during market stress. Additionally, Risk Parity portfolios 
may underperform return-driven strategies during bull markets when concentration in high-return assets 
would be beneficial.
